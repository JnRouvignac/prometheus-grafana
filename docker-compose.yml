# cAdvisor (Container Advisor) provides container users an understanding of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers.
# It is a running daemon that collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information about running containers.
# Specifically, for each container it keeps resource isolation parameters, historical resource usage, histograms of complete historical resource usage and network statistics.
# This data is exported by container and machine-wide.

# https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway
# The Prometheus Pushgateway exists to allow ephemeral and batch jobs to expose their metrics to Prometheus.
# Since these kinds of jobs may not exist long enough to be scraped, they can instead push their metrics to a Pushgateway.
# The Pushgateway then exposes these metrics to Prometheus.
